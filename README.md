- React Toastify 11.0.5
- @react-oauth/google for Google authentication
- Formik & Yup for form validation
- Date-fns 4.1.0 for date manipulation
- Framer Motion 12.6.5 for animations
- Vite 6.2.0 for development and building

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js 4.18.2
- MongoDB 8.13.2 with Mongoose ODM
- JWT Authentication (jsonwebtoken 9.0.2)
- Nodemailer 6.10.1 for email services

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

LegacyNote employs a modern, decoupled architecture:

### Client Application
- Single-page React application with component-based architecture
- Context API for global state management
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### Server API
- RESTful API built with Express
- MVC architecture with controllers, models, and routes
- Middleware for authentication, error handling, and request validation
- Robust error handling and logging

### Data Flow
1. User interactions trigger API requests from the client
2. Server authenticates and validates requests
3. Controllers process business logic and interact with database models
4. Responses are formatted and returned to the client
5. Task scheduler monitors for notes due for delivery
6. Email service sends notifications when notes are delivered

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- MongoDB (Atlas account)
- npm or yarn
- Google OAuth API credentials (for Google authentication)
- Cloudinary account (for media storage)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/legacynote.git
   cd legacynote
   ```

2. **Server Setup**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. **Client Setup**
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

4. **Database Setup**
   - Create a MongoDB Atlas account and cluster
   - Update MONGODB_URI in server/.env with your connection string

5. **Start Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Start the server (from server directory)
   npm run dev
   
   # Start the client (from client directory)
   npm run dev
   ```

## üìù Usage

### Development Environment

**Run Backend Only**
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```
The server will start on http://localhost:5000 with nodemon for auto-reloading.

**Run Frontend Only**
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```
The development server will start on http://localhost:5173 with hot module replacement.

### Scheduler Status

When the server starts, the note delivery scheduler will initialize and display:
```
[SCHEDULER] INFO: Note Delivery Scheduler running...
[SCHEDULER] INFO: Scheduled note delivery checks every minute
```

This indicates the background process is properly monitoring the database for notes that need to be delivered.

### Key Application Workflows

1. **User Registration & Authentication**
   - Register with email and password or Google OAuth
   - Verify email with OTP
   - Login to access dashboard

2. **Creating a Time Capsule Note**
   - Fill in recipient details, delivery date, and content
   - Attach media files if desired
   - Select public/private status
   - Submit and confirm scheduling

3. **Managing Notes**
   - View all notes from dashboard
   - Edit or delete notes before delivery date
   - Generate shareable links for public notes
   - Track delivery status

4. **Note Delivery Process**
   - System monitors for notes reaching delivery date
   - Recipient receives email notification
   - Recipient can access note via secure link
   - Original creator can see delivery confirmation
